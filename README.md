Hello everyone,
This is my third task as a Data Science & Business Analytics Intern with The Sparks Foundation under 
hashtag
#GRIPNOVEMBER23  batch.
The objective of this task is: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
From the dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’, we have to find out the weak areas where we can work to make more profit.
In data mining, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analysing datasets to summarise their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is used for seeing what the data can tell us before the modelling task. 
Workflow behind Implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
1. Read data.
2. Understand data.
3. Clean the data.
4. Plotting the Data 
5. Infer conclusions from the plots.
